oldiconutil
===========

A tool to postprocess iconutil-generated .icns files to make them compatible
with Mac OS X 10.5

Syntax
------

	oldiconutil [--inplace] <icnsFilePath>

Takes the given .icns file and creates a new icon that displays correctly
on Mac OS X 10.5 next to it. E.g. give it AndysNewIcon.icns and it creates
a file AndysNewIcon_10_5.icns in the same directory.

If you pass the --inplace option, it will replace the given file with the
converted file instead of creating a new, renamed icon file.

Background
----------

In Mac OS X 10.6, Apple introduced support for PNG-compressed icon data in
.icns files. In Mac OS X 10.8, Apple introduced support for Retina icons and
the iconutil command-line tool for generating icons from a folder of PNG files.

However, iconutil only knows how to generate PNG-compressed icon data, which
means that you can't use it to create a Retina icon that will still display
properly on Mac OS X 10.5.

Solution
--------

oldiconutil post-processes any .icns files you give it, extracts the PNG data
and re-compresses it using JPEG 2000. If you give it an icon generated by
iconutil, you can create a Retina icon that displays correctly and beautifully
on Mac OS X 10.8 all the way back through Mac OS X 10.5
